# TODO

- block tasks in ui
- unblock tasks in ui
- load project into refdb. Store ref, objtype, id, parent ids (for redirecting), name/subject
- have setup() load project (i know this is atrocious practice but idrc)
- view roles
- manage roles?
- create invitations 
- view/manage members
- allow selecting tasks and stuff by `[ref]<CR>` (not just `*hover*<CR>`)
- blink.cmp source for refs (allow in gitcommit files and taiga files)?
- parse texts for refs: (description blocks, blocked by messages)
- Ref component that allows `gd` or something
- /ref/ route that redirects to the ref's page
- telescope source for finding refs (lowkey could have a banana ui to draw to the preview)
- show comments?
